See through you, we can.
Afraid to lose her..I think.
Eveything. Fear is the path to the dark side... fear leads to

Then continue, we will.
...Correct you were, Qui-Gon.
Clouded, this boy's future is. Masked by his youth.
An apprentice, you have, Qui-Gon. Impossible, to take on a second.
Ready so early, are you? What know you of ready?
Our own council we will keep on who is ready. More to learn, he
And draw out the Queen's attacker.
Young Skywalker's fate will be decided later.
Train him not. Take him with you, but train him not!
May the Force be with you.
Confer on you, the level of Jedi Knight the Coucil does. But agree
The Chosen One the boy may be; nevertheless, grave danger I fear in
Qui-Gon's defiance I sense in you. Need that, you do not. Agree, the

Premonitions . . . premonitions . . . Hmmmm . . . these visions you have . . .
Yourself you speak of, or someone you know?
. . . close to you?
Careful you must be when sensing the future, Anakin. The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.
Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not. Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed, that is.
Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.
Allow this appointment lightly, the Council does not. Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine.
Hiding in the Outer Rim, Grievous is. The outlying systems, you must sweep.
Master Kenobi, our spies contact, you must, and then wait.
Go, I will. Good relations with the Wookiees, I have.
Too much under the sway of the Chancellor, he is. Much anger there is in him. Too much pride in his powers.
A prophecy . . . that misread could have been.
I hope right you are. And now destroy the Droid armies on Kashyyyk, I will. May the Force be with you.
Act on this, we must. The capture of General Grievous will end this war. Quickly and decisively we should proceed.
A Master is needed, with more experience.
Obi-Wan, my choice is.
I agree.
Then now the time is, Commander.
To a dark place this line of thought will carry us. Hmmmmm. . . . great care we must take.
Stink, this mud does. A moment to bathe, give me.
Not far, are we, from the emergency ship. Quickly . . .
Good-bye. Chewbacca and Tarfful, miss you I will. Good friends you are. For your help, much gratitude and respect, I have.
Master Kenobi, dark times are these. Good to see you. it is.
With the help of the Wookiees, barely escape, I did.
Heard from no one, have we.
Received a coded retreat message, we have.
Suggest dismantling the coded signal, do you?
I agree. In a dark place we find ourselves ... a little more knowledge might light our way.
If a special session of Congress there is, easier for us to enter the Jedi Temple it will be.
Dismantle the coded signal quickly. That group back there, soon discovered will be.
Killed not by clones, this Padawan. By a lightsaber, he was.
Good . . . For the Clones to discover the recalibration, a long time it will take. To change it back, longer still. Hurry.
If into the security recordings you go, only pain will you find.
Destroy the Sith, we must.
To fight this Lord Sidious, strong enough, you are not.
Twisted by the dark side, young Skywalker has become. The boy you trained, gone he is . . . Consumed by Darth Vader.
To question, no time there is.
Use your feelings, Obi-Wan, and find him, you will. Visit the new Emperor, my task is. May the Force be with you.
I hear a new apprentice, you have. Emperor, or should I call you Darth Sidious.
Surprised?
Not if anything I have to say about it, Lord Sidious.
At an end your rule is and not short enough it was, I must say.
If so powerful you are, why leave??
Faith in your new apprentice, misplaced may be, as is your faith in the dark side of the Force.
Destroy you I will, just as Master Kenobi, your apprentice will destroy.
Hurry. Careful timing we will need.
Into exile I must go. Failed, I have.
Failed to stop the Sith Lord, I have. Still much to learn, there is ...
Eternal consciousness.
. . . to become one with the Force, and influence still have . . . A power greater than all, it is.
A great Jedi Master, you have become, Qui-Gon Jinn. Your apprentice I gratefully become.
Save them, we must. They are our last hope.
Pregnant, she must still appear. Hidden, safe, the children must be kept.
Split up, they should be.
To Tatooine. To his family, send him.
Strong the Force runs, in the Skywalker line. Hope, we can . . . Done, it is. Until the time is right, disappear we will.
Master Kenobi, wait a moment. In your solitude on Tatooine, training I have for you.
An old friend has learned the path to immortality.
One who has returned from the netherworld of the Force to train me . . . your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn.
The secret of the Ancient Order of the Whills, he studied. How to commune with him. I will teach you.
How to join the Force, he will train you. Your consciousness you will retain, when one with the Force. Even your physical self, perhaps.


Hmmm. Much anger in him, like his father.
Hah. He is not ready.
Ready, are you? What know you of ready? For eight hundred years have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained! A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. This one a long time have I watched. All his life has he looked away... to the future, to the horizon. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh! Excitement. Heh! A Jedi craves not these things. You are reckless!
He is too old. Yes, too old to begin the training.
Will he finished what he begins?
Oh, you will be. You will be.
Run! Yes. A Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware of the dark side. Anger... fear... aggression. The dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice.
No... no... no. Quicker, easier, more seductive.
You will know. When you are calm, at peace. Passive. A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack.
No, no, there is no why. Nothing more will I teach you today. Clear your mind of questions. Mmm. Mmmmmmmm.
That place... is strong with the dark side of the Force. A domain of evil it is. In you must go.
Only what you take with you.
Your weapons... you will not need them.
Use the Force. Yes...
Now... the stone. Feel it.
Concentrate!
So certain are you. Always with you it cannot be done. Hear you nothing that I say?
No! No different! Only different in your mind. You must unlearn what you have learned.
No! Try not. Do. Or do not. There is no try.
Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? Hm? Mmmm.
And well you should not. For my ally in the Force. And a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. Its energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we... ... not this crude matter. You must feel the Force around you. Here, between you... me... the tree... the rock... everywhere! Yes, even between this land and that ship!
That is why you fail.
Concentrate... feel the Force flow. Yes. Good. Calm, yes. Through the Force, things you will see. Other places. The future... the past. Old friends long gone.
Hmm. Control, control. You must learn control.
Mmm. Friends you have there.
It is the future you see.
Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future.
Decide you must how to serve them best. If you leave now, help them you could. But you would destroy all for which they have fought and suffered.
Luke! You must complete the training.
You must not go!
Yes, yes. To Obi-Wan you listen. The cave. Remember your failure at the cave!
Stopped they must be. On this all depends. Only a fully trained Jedi Knight with the Force as his ally will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path, as Vader did, you will become an agent of evil.
If you honor what they fight for ... yes!
Strong is Vader. Mind what you have learned. Save you it can.
Told you, I did. Reckless is he. Now matters are worse.
No. There is another.


Hmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes?
Soon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, I have.
Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force.
No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.
Mmm... rest I need. Yes... rest.
Your father he is.
Told you, did he?
Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...
Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware. Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they. Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.
Luke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor, or suffer your father's fate, you will. Luke, when gone am I , the last of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned, Luke... There is...another...Sky...Sky...walker.
